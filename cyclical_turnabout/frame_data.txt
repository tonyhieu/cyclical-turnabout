When I was a kid, I used to think a lot about death.

null:
It wasn't like I was sick or anything. It just interested me.

null:
I have one vivid memory about death.

null:
My family was on a vacation with our grandparents, and I was sharing a room with my grandma.

null:
In the middle of the night, I woke up to her crying.

null:
I asked her, "What's wrong?"

null:
Through sobs, she said, "I don't want to die."

null:
"I want to watch you grow up. I want to spend time with you."

null:
I tried to console her. I told her, "We can both go into the afterlife and spend the rest of time there."

null:
I didn't really know what I was saying, but she calmed down a bit after that.

null:
I've thought about that night a lot for the past twenty years.

null:
Is it really that sad to leave this world behind?

null:
Before my grandma passed away, I talked about that night with her.

null:
She was weak and bedridden, but she still smiled hearing me describe it back to her.

null:
She said, "It's okay. I know you'll keep your promise."

null:
A part of me thought that I should rewind to etch my grandma's face into my memory.

null:
A stronger part of me left the hospital and drove home in silence.

null:
That same part of me didn't cry at her funeral. Or any other funeral I've been at.

null:
I suppose it was just fate.

null:
Fate. What a funny idea.

null:
What card do you think this is?

null:
There are fifty-two possibilities. You have less than a 2% chance to guess correctly.

null:
But is that really true?

null:
There is only one card. There is only one outcome.

null:
You can rewind too, right? Why don't you check the card and see if I'm right?

null:
Because I know you know...

...it was a nine of diamonds all along.

null:
Rewind as many times as you want. It will always be the nine of diamonds.

null:
Life is the same way.

null:
Your fate is determined from the start. It is ineffable, unchanging.

null:
You have no control. All you can do is watch and see.

null:
There is a chance I'm wrong, though.

null:
Maybe we can change our destinies. Maybe our outcomes are not set in stone.

null:
The onus to prove that on you, my friend.

null:
The stage is set. Our destinies have intertwined.
